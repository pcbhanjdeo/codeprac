C++ cookbook chap 12:
----------------------
1) what is the header file that should be included for boost threads?
a) the header file is:
   #include <boost/thread/thread.hpp>
   #include <boost/thread/xtime.hpp>

2) How do you create a thread object in boost ?
a) the thread object is created by invoking the constructor of the thread object and then passing the function pointer 
   of the function.
   boost::thread myThread(func);

3) what is a yield() function ?
a) on a single processor, we use the yield() directive to the compiler to tell it that we would like to give away the time slice
   of the current thread to others.

4) what is join()?
a) a join() is like a barrier, if main thread finishes its work before child threads it will close the process killing the
   child threads in the process, if we use join() call then the main thread waits for the child thread to finsh.

5) write a simple multi threaded application with and with out join where the thread prints writes first thousand
   numbers to the output see what happens ?

6) repeat the above excersize with yield() function with out join(), what is the result?
a)
