 just like we have a reference to a object we suppose we can have a reference array as well.

int& a[10] = b; 
throws an error since there is no such thing called a array of reference objects.

since & is left assosiate, we need to use a brace to make the assosiation clear.

int (&a)[10] = b;
when we declare like above we are making array a a reference of b => changing value in b reflects on a.

in the same way we can have a read only reference arrays as well.

const int (&a)[10] = b;
=> we can change b and it will reflect on a, but no changes can be made on b at all.

check test8.cpp for code example.
