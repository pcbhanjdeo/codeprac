1) How would we ensure that no body is able to copy our object ?
   we can ensure that no body copies our object by making the copy constructor and assignment operator private. 
   if we do not make copy constructor and assignment operator private then compiler provides them and we will 
   not be able to stop any body from creating a copy.

   check test1.cpp

2) how do you ensure that nobody ever creates a object of your class ?
   we achieve that by making the constructor private.

3) how do you ensure that no one creates a object of class, but only its children can ?
   we can achieve it by making the constructor protected.
