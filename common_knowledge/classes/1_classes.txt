 a class is a user defined data type.
 it allows the user to code closer to the problem domain.

 a class has three access specifiers.
 public - accesible to all, normally class methods(functions) are made public.
 private - only accesible to class methods, these are called state variables. 
 protected - accesible ponly to children.

 an object of a class has only a copy of the data variables in it, it does not have functions in the object size.
