 
we use inheritcence for code reuse.

1) what is the process of function look up ?
   There are 3 steps for function lookup:
   1) search for the function name match
   2) search for the best suited function based on the argument type.
   3) check for access of the function.

2) when we have a function in the base class and we have a function with the name in the derived class what happens ?
   function over loading and overriding compete with each other, if we have 2 functions with same name in the base class and derived class
   so when a function call is made, based on function lookup steps, compiler first searches the name in the current class scope and finds
   the wrong function and generates an error since it thinks there is a argument mismatch, it never gets to the functions inherited from
   the base class.
