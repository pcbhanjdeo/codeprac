 
  C++ provides the same functionality for the data in the file manipulation as same as any other stream, the header for the same is 
#include <fstream>
f - stands for file.

There is a input file class and output file class under fstream, called ifstream and ofstream (analogus to istream and ostream)

but unlike cin and cout, the standard istream and ostream object C++ doesnt have any objects defined.

so we will have to declare our own objects.

ifstream inputFile;
ofstream outputFile;

1) how do you initialize the ifstream object ?
   ifstream inputFile("inputFile.data");  //calling the ifstream class constructor.
   or
   ifstream inputFile;                //calling ifstream default constructor
   inputFile.open("inputFile.data");  //calling the open function with file path.

   we give the relative or absolute path of the file we need to open, user defined ifstream class object inputFile will open the file and establish 
   the connection between data file and the process that has called to open it.

   if a file does not exist then no file will be created and error will be returned.

2) how do you initialize a ofstream object ?
   ofstream outputFile.open("writeMe.data");

   we give the relative or absolute path of the file, if no file with that name exists then operation system will create one for us.

3) what is a fail() member function ?
ans) fail function is used to check if last operation was succesfull or not,
     eg:

     ifstream iFile("myFile.txt");
     if(iFile.fail())
     {
       //failed to open last file
     }

     check
