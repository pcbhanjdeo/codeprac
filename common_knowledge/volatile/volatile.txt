 volatile is a key word where we are explicily commanding the compiler not to do any optimizations at all.

each time we want a variable that is declared as volatile the compiler reaches for the source rather than depend on its cache or memory.

eg:

volatile const int i = 10;

 The above declaration means that the variable cannot be modified with in the scope of the program but it can and will be changed 
outside of it.

 The volatile variable is normally used in multi threading where various threads access the same global variable and when a value of a 
particular value is used we want it to take the latest value and not some thing that is stored some where.
