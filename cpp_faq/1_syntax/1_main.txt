1) what is main ?
   main() is a function that the machine calls first, by default it has storage class specifier extern, a program must have a 
   main() function, and only one main function, its address cannot be taken.

2) what are dont's pertaining to main() ?
   (a) its address cannot be taken.
   (b) it cannot be a static function.
   (c) it cannot be inlined either
   (d) main() cannot call itself.
   (e) main() cannot be called from other functions.

3) can I over load main function ?
   example:
   int main()
   int main(int a, int b, int c);

   we cannot overload main() function, the standard explcitly forbades it since it does not want any name mangling in picture, 
   and wants main() to exactly be what it is expected.

4) can you call main() function from with in main() ?
   yes we can, through gcc, but -pedantic flag with the g++ throws an error.
   check test2.cpp

5) can you call main() from some other function ?
   yes we can from g++, again -pedantic dosent let you do that.
   check test3.cpp
  
6) what are the arguments that main takes ?
   main() takes two arguments, 
   int argc -> argument count.
   char** argv -> argument vector, pointer to an array of char* pointers.

   int main(int argc, char** argv)
   {
      *argv;  //prints char* string
      ++argv;
   }

   check test4.cpp
