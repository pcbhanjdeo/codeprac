1) what is a translation unit ?
a translation unit is sort of scope, it is the file that is fed to the compiler after the preprocessor is run on it, the translation unit
removes all the lines that are excluded using #ifdefs and #ifndefs and all the header files are included recurcively. 

  The above translation unit is fed to the compiler to get object files, which are later combined by the linker to generate the
executable file.

2) what is ODR ?
   ODR stands for one definition rule, it states that a non inline function is defined exactly once across all files and inline functions
and classes are defined atmost once in a translation unit.
