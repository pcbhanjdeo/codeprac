can a constant pointer be assigned to a regular pointer ?

eg:

int* const pc = new int[10];
int* p = pc;

is that legal and why ?

ans) that is legal since, we are only saying that the pointer is constant, that is, the address stored in it can never change, some one else
     can have the same address and make changes, this is used because, it will be easy to play around with non const pointer on the buffer
     and when we are done we can delete the location what we should

     eg:

     p++;
     *p = 10;

     delete []pc;

     this way we do not have to come back to the start point of the array.

     check test2.cpp
