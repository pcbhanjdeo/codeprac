 we are never supposed to mix new and malloc, by that we mean if a object is created using new then we should remove it calling delete.
 and if we create a memory using malloc the we should remove it using free(), never mix them both.

 we should always prefer using new and delete over malloc and free, since malloc and free just allocate a chunk of memory and are totally
unaware of constructor and destructor.

 when we create objects using mallaoc, we are not calling constructors at all and when free is used since destructors are not called
 we will loose memory if object allocates memory as well.
