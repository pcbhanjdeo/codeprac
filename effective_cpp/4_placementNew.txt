what is placement new and why is it used ?
we can always allocate and initialize an object in C++ using new operator.
but there can be situations where allocating memory is quite expensive, so you keep the memory allocated before hand and initialize it when 
needed, these are called memory pools.

 all the containers use placement new, get chunks of memory aside for themselves and initialize it when needed and do not delete them when 
removed, these things are called memory pools they are very efficient.

 another usage is when we want a particular object to be shared by multiple processes.

syntax
---------
#include <new>
char memory[sizeof(class name)];
--> memory becomes the address of the memory pool.
type* typePointer = new (address) constructor-call.



syntax:
#include <new>
char memory[sizeof(A)];
A* pA = new(memory) A();

we need to call the destructor explictly for this:
pA->~A();

check test3.cpp
