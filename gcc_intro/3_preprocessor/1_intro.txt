Preprocessor runs before any program compilation.

the preprocessor macros are defined in capital letters.

#define MAX 10

semicolns are not used.

1) what are the most prominet uses of preprocessor ?
   (a) adding a header file ( #include <cmath> )
   (b) ensuring that a file is added only once.
       #ifndef CLASS_A
       #define CLASS_A
      
       class A
       {};
 
       #endif

       The above will ensure that a class is added only once.

    (c) blocking some code using macro's
        the values are passed from the command prompt using -D option.
        check test1.cpp
        to enable the debug code we have to give the following option.
     
        g++ -g -Wall -DDEBUG test1.cpp -o test1

    (d) passing a value to a macro throgh compiler option using -DNAME=10
