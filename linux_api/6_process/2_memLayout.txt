1) what are the major memory segments in a process ?
a) the following are the major memory segments in a process.
   1) text segment - contains the code in machine instruction format, it is read only.
   2) initialized memory segment - contains all the global and static variables that are initialized.
   3) uninitialized memory segment - contains all the global and static variables that are not initialized.
   4) stack - this is a dynamically growing and shrinking segment where each frame is allocated to each called function and it will contain
              all the variables internal to that function.
   5) heap - this is the area from which memory can be dynamically allocated.

2) why do we need two different segments for initialized and uninitialized global and static variables ?
a) when storing on the disk, no seperate space is required for uninitialized variables.

3) what is an Application Binary Interface (ABI) ?
a) an application binary interface is a set of rules that specify how a binary executable exchanges information with any service, an ABI
   specifies which regsiters and stack locations should be used for information exchange and how they are to be interpreted.

4) what is virtual memory ?

5) what is page error ?

6) what is page space ?
