Grep Options:
-------------
1) what does grep stand for?
a) general regular expression parser is the full form for grep.

2) what is the syntax structure of grep?
a) grep [options] expression_that_needs_searching filename_where_the_expression_is_to_be_searched

3) what are the options available for grep and what do they stand for?
a) -i --- ignore case
   -n --- prints the line numbers of the line
   -r --- recursively go through the file system.
   -v --- inverse search where the line is not matched.
   -l --- only the file names where the expression is found are printed, not the lines.
   -L --- only the file names where the expression is not found are printed.
   -h --- only the lines that match the expression are printed, not the file names where it is found.
   -w --- whole word no sub string matches.

   IGNORE CASE
   ignore CaSE
   ignore case

   $ grep "IgNoRe CaSe" exp1.txt
     IgNoRe CaSe

   $ grep -i "IGNORE CASE" exp1.txt
     IGNORE CASE
     ignore case
     IgNoRe CaSe
