Meta Charecters and Literals
-----------------------------
1) what are meta charecters?
a) the charecters that are used as a place holders for any other charecters is called a meta charecters.
   eg: b*c, matches any charecter that starts with b and ends with c.

2) what are the standard meta charecters?
a) There are 12 standard meta charecters:
   () {} [] - ? . * ^ $ + | \ 

3) what are anchor charecters and what are they used for?
a) anchor charecters tell if a particular expression is at the beggining of the line or end of the line.
   eg1: ^zip matches all the lines that start with zip

        $ grep ^zip testDir/dirlist*
	testDir/dirlist-usr.bin.txt:zip
	testDir/dirlist-usr.bin.txt:zipcloak
	testDir/dirlist-usr.bin.txt:zipdetails
	testDir/dirlist-usr.bin.txt:zipgrep
	testDir/dirlist-usr.bin.txt:zipinfo
	testDir/dirlist-usr.bin.txt:zipnote
	testDir/dirlist-usr.bin.txt:zipsplit

   eg2: zip$ matches all the lines that end with zip

	$ grep zip$ testDir/dirlist*
	testDir/dirlist-bin.txt:gunzip
	testDir/dirlist-bin.txt:gzip
	testDir/dirlist-usr.bin.txt:funzip
	testDir/dirlist-usr.bin.txt:gpg-zip
	testDir/dirlist-usr.bin.txt:mzip
	testDir/dirlist-usr.bin.txt:preunzip
	testDir/dirlist-usr.bin.txt:prezip
	testDir/dirlist-usr.bin.txt:unzip
	testDir/dirlist-usr.bin.txt:zip

4) How will you pick a line that only has a zip in it?
a) we use anchor charecter at the beggining and at the end of the word zip

   $ grep ^zip$ testDir/dirlist* 
   testDir/dirlist-usr.bin.txt:zip

5) How will you match all the empty lines in a file?
a) empty lines are matched by ^$ anchor charecters.

6) How will you measure how many empty lines are there in a file using grep?
a) The empty lines is a file can be counted by -c option of grep along with anchor charecters.
   $ grep -c ^$ <file name>

7) How is the special charecter [] is used ?
a) [] is used to give a range of values or a few values for a single substitution.
   eg: $ grep [bg]zip <file names> will match anyline that contains bzip or gzip.
   
       grep -h [bg]zip testDir/dirlist*
       bzip2
       bzip2recover
       gzip

8) what will happen if both the charecters are present in a line?
a) it will still only pick one of the charecters and search for it and then print the result.
   eg: grep [bz]ip <file name> 
   will first search for bip and then for zip in each line of the file, bip matches no where but zip matches in many places.

9) what is the negation of charecter set?
a) when we use a carrot charecter at the beginning of a set, we use it as a negation effectively saying we do not want this
   expression to be searched.
   eg: grep [^bg]zip <file name> will match anyline that 'does not' contain bzip or gzip.

   $ grep -h [^bg]zip testDir/dirlist*
     
     bunzip2
     gunzip
     funzip
     gpg-zip

10) How would you print all expressions that start with a upper case letter?
 a) $ grep ^[A-Z] <file name> 
    The above line prints all the lines in a file that start with a upper case letter.

    $ grep -h ^[A-Z] testDir/dirlist*
      
      MAKEDEV
      ControlPanel
      FBReader
      X
      X11

11) what is the difference between expression ^[A-Z] and [^A-Z] ?
 a) The difference is in the first expression we are searching for lines that start with a upper case letter.
    in the second expression we are serching for a line that has 'no' upper case letter.

12) what do we do if we want to search for a literal charecter ^ or - ?
 a) for ^ we keep it any where but the beggining.
    [^A-Z] means anything but upper case letters.
    [A-Z^] means all upper case letters plus the '^' charecter => ^ looses its significance when we put it in a different location.
  
    same with - as well:
    [A-Z] means all upper case letters.
    [-AZ] means only charecters -, A and Z.
