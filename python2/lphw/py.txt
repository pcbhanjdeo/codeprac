LEARN PYTHON THE HARD WAY:
----------------------------

1) How to check which version of python you are using?
a) $ python --version
   prints which version of python is being used.

2) How do you compile a python program? 
a) $ python ex.py 
   where we are invoking the python compiler with python command and ex.py is the file name and .py is the extension for python.

3)will a file compile if we use a different extension instead of .py, say .abc ?
a) it works, test1.abc prints what we want it to print.

4) How do you print something in python?
a) "print" keyword followed by a quoted string is used to print strings
   "print" followed by an expression can also be used.

    eg: print "bhanj is god"
        print 5+7   // prints 12 

5) How do you comment some thing in python?
a) we use a # sign at the beginning of the line to comment it, # = // in C++.

6) what happens if you do not give quotes for a string in print statement?
a) print bhanj is god
   throws error.
   only way to print the above line is:
   print "bhanj is god"

7) what is % operator ?
a) a % is called a modulus operator, it gives the reminder when a division is performed.
   12 % 2 = 0, since 12 is a multiple of 2.
   12 % 10 = 2, since 2 is the reminder when 12 is divided by 10.

8) what happens if you print 10/4 ? 
a) 10 divided by 4 is 2.5, but we see 2
   check ex4.py
   to get a proper fraction value we need to use atleast one variable as a flotiong point.
   i.e  10/4  = 2
        10.0 / 4.0 = 2.5
        10   / 4.0 = 2.5
        10.0 / 4   = 2.5

9) How do you mix strings and expressions?
a) we mix string and expressions by using ,.
   eg: print "the value of 5 + 7 = ", 5+7
   output : the value of 5 + 7 = 12

10) what is the operator precedence?
 a) () has the highest precedence.
    ** has the next higher precedence.
    the / and * have equal precedence.
    the % has next higer precedence.
    the + and - have equal precedence.

    
11) what has higher precedence? % or *?
 a) * has higher precedence over %

12) what has higher precedence? % or +?
 a) % has higher precedence over +

13) what has higher precedence? * or **?
 a) ** has higher precedence over *
